This is not a finished release 

# How to use 

Set a start charge level and a stop charge level. 

If the battery level is below the start charge level, the battery mode is set to normal. If the battery level is higher than the stop charge level, the battery mode is set to conservation. 

If the "Always charge" checkbox is checked, then when the laptop has gone from unplugged to plugged in it will always charge to the stop charge level.
